                                <p>The evolution of our Kratos ROV design has
                                    been characterized by an ongoing pursuit of
                                    improved
                                    performance, versatility, and efficiency. In
                                    Kratos ROV, our focus is on ensuring basic
                                    functionality and
                                    ruggedness for various tasks. Throughout the
                                    competition contribution, advancements in
                                    ROV design
                                    concepts have led to the adoption of more
                                    durable and lightweight materials, resulting
                                    in sleeker designs
                                    capable of executing all missions
                                    effectively.
                                    This year, the integration of sophisticated
                                    sensors, cameras, and manipulator arms has
                                    significantly expanded
                                    the capabilities of our ROV, enabling it to
                                    undertake a wide range of tasks.
                                    Additionally, enhancements in
                                    control systems and communication
                                    technologies have bolstered the operability
                                    of our ROV, enabling more
                                    precise and intuitive operation by our team

                                <h4>Mechanical Design
                                    Process</h4>
                                <p>Kratos’s design is completely distinctive. It
                                    is based and improves on previously
                                    manufactured ROVs. A considerable amount of
                                    time has been spent researching the
                                    advantages and disadvantages of the previous
                                    models, especially the 2022 & 2023 design
                                    concepts, as well as thinking about ways in
                                    which they could be improved. Following the
                                    design team's agreement on the schematics
                                    and the creation of freehand sketches-fig
                                    (1). The real work began with 3D modeling
                                    using SOLIDWORKS -fig (2) as a starting
                                    point. We simulated water flow through our
                                    vehicle by CFD using ANSYS fluent fig (3).
                                    So, we tested our design before
                                    Manufacturing. The mechanical design team
                                    put in a lot of effort, but their main
                                    challenge was getting our vehicle to move
                                    smoothly. This was achieved by our
                                    streamlined shapes that minimize the drag
                                    force on the design. The electrical team
                                    incorporated electronic components into our
                                    ROV through meticulous planning and close
                                    collaboration with the design team. This
                                    allowed for responsive control over the
                                    ROV's maneuvering path.</p>

                                    Approach</h4>
                                <p>As we mentioned before Kratos ROV is the
                                    result of combining the 2022 ROV propulsion
                                    system - fig (5), which is represented by
                                    six thrusters - with the previous year's
                                    frame design - fig (6), where an aluminum
                                    extrusion profile is used with an opening
                                    design concept of the frame structure that
                                    minimizes drag force and reduces eddies in
                                    the water. This year's ROVs have more
                                    payloads such as two new cameras and a
                                    rotational manipulator.
                                    Kratos ROV utilizes several innovative
                                    design features to retain excellent
                                    operational efficiency and control. For
                                    size, the main three dimensions of the ROV
                                    is 44.4 cm, 42 cm, and 52.6 cm. the vehicle
                                    was designed to fit in the launch and return
                                    area so it fits in 62 cm of circle diameter
                                    -fig (7) which is smaller than the 99 cm
                                    -fig (8) that the ROV must pilot through.
                                    For weight, The Kratos ROV weighs 11.4 Kg in
                                    the air, without a 25-meter Tether weight
                                    meeting the competition's weight requirement
                                    with the maximum bonus. In freshwater, the
                                    Kratos ROV can carry out missions deeper
                                    than 10 meters.

                                    Stability</h4>
                                <p>The enclosure on the Kratos ROV displaces the
                                    most water, at 6055311.91 cubic centimeters,
                                    which is why it was put at the top of the
                                    ROV. The center of buoyancy (CB) is shifted
                                    upwards fig (15), counterbalancing the
                                    entire weight of the ROV and any payloads it
                                    may be carrying. The Kratos ROV has a great
                                    level of stability because the weights are
                                    placed at the bottom. As the foam is added,
                                    the result is a somewhat positively buoyant
                                    ROV that can be readily canceled out by the
                                    vertical thrusters when needed. Because of
                                    the symmetrical, the ROV’s CB and CG are
                                    centered in the middle of the Kratos ROV and
                                    there are reference distance of X, Y, and Z
                                    with the origin point of the ROV.</p>

                                <p>Kratos ROV was designed to maintain all
                                    degrees of freedom required for maneuvering.
                                    As a first option, we could use two inclined
                                    T200 thrusters and two forward T100
                                    thrusters to create a four-thruster
                                    configuration. This configuration was used
                                    in the 2023 ROV -fig (16), and it reduced
                                    power consumption and cost, but the thrust
                                    force in all directions was not sufficient
                                    to maneuver smoothly. Our second option was
                                    to utilize four thrusters T200, which were
                                    affordable, consumed more amounts of power,
                                    and slightly increased thrust force values,
                                    but did not include all degrees of freedom
                                    needed. </p>

                                <p>So, the third option we have chosen is to
                                    upgrade the number of thrusters
                                    and change the overall configuration
                                    which
                                    is composed of 6 used T-200

                                    (17). T-200 thrusters are capable of
                                    producing thrust up to 3.55 Kgf in
                                    forward
                                    operation and 3.00 Kgf in reverse
                                    operation.
                                    Two Vertical thrusters are placed on the
                                    center line of the Kratos ROV

                                    to provide stability and balance for the
                                    ROV
                                    while propelling upwards or downwards
                                    resulting in the values of the upward
                                    and
                                    downward thrust forces -Table (2).

                                    The 4 horizontal thrusters are aligned
                                    with
                                    an angle of 45⁰ providing a variety of
                                    maneuvering options in all directions
                                    with a
                                    good combination of speeds. Forward,
                                    backward, right, or left can be
                                    performed
                                    with 2 thrusters in forward operation
                                    during
                                    normal speed maneuvering or can be
                                    increased
                                    by using the 4 thrusters out of which 2
                                    are
                                    forward operated and the other 2 reverse
                                    operated. The angle 45⁰ was selected to
                                    give
                                    a good thrust component in the forward,
                                    backward, and lateral movement. This
                                    alignment of thrusters also enables
                                    Kratos
                                    Rov to rotate clockwise or
                                    anti-clockwise
                                    using 2 or 4 thrusters in the same way
                                    used
                                    for lateral movements.
                                    After the first underwater testing, team
                                    members found that we needed a higher
                                    value
                                    of the forward movement than the lateral
                                    movement, so finally, we changed the
                                    four
                                    horizontal thrusters’ angles from 45⁰ to
                                    60⁰
                                    resulting in the values of the forward,
                                    and
                                    backward maximum thrust forces -Table
                                    (2).
                                    Alongside this combination of thrusters
                                    Kratos ROV, speed can be altered using
                                    our
                                    control system to give the best suitable
                                    speed for any specific mission or task.

                                    In the enclosure, no chemical sealant was applied. Moreover, the enclosure has a 5mm-thick laser-cut clear PMMA face from one side -fig (20), and a PMMA dome -fig (19) from the other side, which were selected to provide clear vision for the cameras, as well as to check the compression of the O-ring. HDPE material was selected as there are no pores formed within the material, meaning that it can act as a perfectly sealed container. Stress analysis -fig (19) was made by SolidWorks static analysis to ensure that the enclosure can withstand a pressure up to 10 meters underwater with a factor of safety 1.1.</p>
