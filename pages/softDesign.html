                                    optimize the pilot's field of view,
                                    acknowledging the diverse demands of
                                    different missions involving Kratos -fig
                                    (1). It incorporates four carefully
                                    selected purchased CCTV cameras
                                    and one Blue Robotics camera, each
                                    fulfilling a specific role. The first
                                    camera, angled at 60°, offers a gripper view
                                    crucial for various missions.
                                    The second camera, positioned at a 90°
                                    angle, supervises the upper
                                    equipment retrieval box. The third camera is
                                    dedicated to capturing the
                                    bottom side of the pool, ensuring convenient
                                    viewing of tether. The fourth
                                    camera offers a backward-facing view to
                                    monitor the tether and avoid
                                    entanglement with the propellers. Lastly,
                                    the primary Blue Robotics camera
                                    is forward-facing, providing the pilot's
                                    perspective and primarily deployed
                                    in tasks such as Autonomous Transplanting
                                    and 3D modeling.</p>

                                    <p>The selection of Pixhawk 1 over Pixhawk 4
                                        was
                                        influenced by its compatibility with
                                        essential pressure sensors like the
                                        bar30,
                                        crucial for Kratos' depth control,
